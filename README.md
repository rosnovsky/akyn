# Akyn

Akyn Blog Engine is a project intended for education and fun. 

The project's back end uses the following:
- Node as a server
- Express for routing
- MongoDB for storing data 
- Pug for faster page building
- Stylus for faster styling
(the latter two will eventually be rewritten using React/Redux)

The engine will be API-based, meaning that its front end will be an application which will communicate with the server using this interface.
